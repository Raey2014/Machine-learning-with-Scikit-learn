# Machine-learning-with-Scikit-learn
This is a practical example of machine learning on cancer cells physical attributes (e.g., shape, area, etc) rather than a genomic attributes to predict the breast cancer either benign (not aggressive) or malignant (more aggressive and easily disseminate to distance organ). For the project, I used Jupyter notebook, Pandas, Seaborn and Scikit-learn for data analysis and visualization, and prediction with support vector machine model. The data available at UCI machine learning repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/.
