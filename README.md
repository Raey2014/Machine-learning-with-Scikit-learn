 Machine-learning-with-Scikit-learn
This project is a practical example of the cancer cells physical attribute (e.g., shape, area, etc) rather than a genomic characterization to use machine learning to predict the status of a breast cancer (either its benign not more likely not aggressive and metastasize distant organ from the breast or malignant that are more aggressive and easily disseminate to distance organ ) . For the project, I used Jupyter notebook, Pandas, Seaborn and Scikit-learn for data analysis and visualization, and prediction with support vector machine model. The data available at UCI machine learning repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/.
