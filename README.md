# Machine-learning-with-Scikit-learn
This is a practical example of machine learning on cancer cells physical attributes (e.g., shape, area, etc) rather than genomic attributes to predict the breast cancer either **benign** (not aggressive) or **malignant** (more aggressive and easily disseminate to distant organs). 
For this project, I used _Jupyter notebook_, 

* Pandas, 
* Seaborn and 
* Scikit-learn for data cleaning and visualizations, and support ** vector machine model** prediction. 
## Data
The data available at **UCI machine learning repository** at [here] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).
