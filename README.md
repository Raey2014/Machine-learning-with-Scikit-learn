# Machine-learning-with-Scikit-learn
This project is a practical example of machine learning using Ipython notebook, Pandas, Seaborn and Scikit-learn for data analysis and 
visualization, and machine predictive machine learning.

In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) 
a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is 
known.
